# Physical Security: Design and Implementation

## Data Center Protection

### Site and facility design

#### Types of facilities

* **Data Centers** access must be limited to prevent damage/disruption
* **Server rooms** are sometimes within a regular office building
* **Media storage facilities** that contain sensitive/important data
* **Evidence storage** rooms: access must be limited to avoid tempering
* **Wiring closets** are routing data throughout a building
* **Distribution cabling** must be protected against unauthorised access

### Environmental Controls

* **air temperature**: *64.4˚F* to *80.6˚F*
* **humidity**: above *41.9˚F* to avoid **static electricity** and below *50.0˚F* to avoid condensation
* racks suck in cold air from the front and blow hot air out at the back
* good data center design makes use of placing racks opposite each other
* cold air can be blow from the bottom to the cold site of a racks
* warm air can be sucked at the hot end of the racks

### Data Center Environmental Protection

* natural disasters: fire, blooding and electromagnetic interference

#### Fire detection and prevention

* a fire needs
  * oxygen
  * fuel
  * heat
* fire extinguishers
  * **A**: common combustIbles (wood, trash)
  * **B**: liquids (petrol, oil)
  * **C**: electric
  * **D**: heavy metal fires
  * **K**: kitchen (fats and oils)
* fire suppression systems
  * **wet pipe** sprinkler: water is always in the pipes (dangerous due to leaking)
  * **dry pipe** sprinkler: water is only pumped in when fire is detected
  * **chemical systems**: deprive room of oxygen (dangerous for humans)

#### Flooding

* data centres should build in a safe location
* a leak in a water pipe can cause flooding, too
* moisture sensors should be used

#### Electromagnetic interference (EMI)

* is generated by electronic devices
* enables eavesdropping
* faraday cages can protect against EMI

### Physical access controls

#### Locks

* *preset locks*: physical locks that require keys (and replacement if key is lost)
* *cipher locks*: physical or electronic key pad (code is required)
* *biometric lock*: uses physical characteristics of users to unlock
* *card-based locks*: use access cards (strip cards, proximity cards or swipe cards)

#### Tailgating

* person rushes in after an authorised person
* **man traps** can prevent this
  * uses two doors
  * exterior door closes after person entered
  * once made sure that a single person is inside the interior door opens

#### Facility Monitoring

* noise detection
* movement detection
* video surveillance
  * provide evidence after an incident took place
  * can use infrared

#### Physical Barriers

* **fences**
* **cages** can be used to separate equipment (e.g. in a shared data center)
* **bollard** prevents vehicles from crashing into a building
* **signs**
  * inform people that access is forbidden
  * provide legal grounds for charges
* **camouflage** hide data centres

### Visitor management

* allowable reasons for entering
* escorted / unescorted access
* who may escort visitors
* visitors access must be logged
* visitors should carry badges (including the information if escort is required)
* use of cameras must be disclosed to visitors

### Physical security personnel

* human guards can grant access
* receptionist may be security guards
* uniforms / outfit can scare off attackers
* robot sentries might replace humans

#### Security principles for humans

* **two-person integrity**
  * two people must enter sensitive area together
  * prevents that a single person steals or examines restricted information
* **two-person control**
  * sensitive actions must be performed by two persons
  * avoids that a single person accidentally performs action (nuclear missile)

## Hardware and data security

### Data lifecycle

#### Process

1. Create
2. Store
3. Use
4. Share
5. Archive
6. Destroy

#### Description

* process ist not guaranteed to run in that order; data can be created but only used in memory

#### Data Sanitisation Techniques

* **clearing**: overwrite data (only against casual analysis)
* **purging**: using advanced techniques against laboratory analysis
* **destroying**: destruction of the data storage media

### Hardware physical security

* risk of physical theft of a device
* encryption can protect the content of a device
* USB data blocker allow charging, but block out data ports
* methods to prevent theft of portable devices
  * **cable lock** (e.g. Kensington lock)
  * **safes** (being also water proof or fire proof)
  * **laptop cabinets** are portable and might charge laptops
  * **security tags** provide instructions on how to return and prevent resale

## Business Continuity

### Business Continuity Planning (BCP)

 * = keep a business running in case of issues (minor to catastrophic)
 * **COOP** (continuity of operations planning)
 * is part of the CIA triangle: **availability**

#### Scope

* business activities
* systems
* controls

#### Business Impact Assessment (BIA)

* identify and prioritise risks
* factors in a cost if a system goes down / gets destroyed

### Business Continuity Controls

* Redundancy: having more than one piece of  a critical hardware/system (= single point of failure)
* SPOF = *single point of failure* analysis
* sudden bankruptcy of a key vendor
* succession planning: if critical people leave - who is going to keep working in their role?

### High Availability & fault tolerance

* **High Availability (HA)**: having multiple systems (in more than one location)
* **Fault Tolerance**: a single system that's resilient against failures

#### Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)

* Raid 1: mirroring - data is written to two (or more) disks
* Raid 5: striping with parity - (3+ disks), parity blocks are spread across

#### Network Redundancy

* choose more than one service provider
* NIC teaming: a server has two network cards

#### Diversity

* choose more than one **vendor**: a single flaw won't affect the entire system
* choose different **technology**

## Disaster Recovery

* = process to restoring a business back to normal operations
* triggered by a natural or man-made disaster
* source: internal or external
* recovery ends only when business is back to normal (operations and location)

### Process

1. contain damage
1. recover what can be restored immediately
1. run more activities

### Metrics

* **Recovery time objective (RTO)**: maximum amount of time it should take to recover
* **Recovery point objective (RPO)**: maximum time period from which data my be lost (how much data has to be restored? TODO!)
* **Recovery service level (RSL)**: percentage of a service that must be available during a disaster

### Backups

* **full backup**
  * creates a complete copy of data
  * takes long to create
  * uses lots of space
* **snapshots**
  * form of full backup
  * rely on hardware
* **differential**
  * include only data changed since the last full backup
  * *only one* backup has to be restored (after restoring the full backup)
* **incremental**
  * only include data since the last full _or_ incremental backup
  * _all_ backups have to be restored (after restoring the full  backup)
  * take less space than differential backups

### Restoring backups

* planned scenario: disaster
* used scenario: accidental deletion of files
* Non-persistence: only back up _unique_ data (user data, not OS)

### Disaster Recovery Sites

* 3 main types

  * **hot**
    * hardware is up and running and data is duplicated to site
    * enables automatic failover
    * expensive (doubled costs)
  * **warm**
    * hardware is ready, but data needs to be transferred in
    * hardware costs identical, but less labour costs
    * hours/days to start up
  * **cold**
    * site needs to be built (empty data centres)
    * inexpensive
    * take long to start

* offsite storage: "site resiliency"

  * geographically distant
  * manual transfer via SAN or VM
  * backups
    * online: fast, but expensive
    * offline: slow, but inexpensive

* alternative business processes as part of recovery plan

### Testing Goals

* 2 goals
  * validate that plan works
  * identify plan updates where it doesn't work yet
* 5 types
  * **read-throughs**: checklist reviews to gather feedback
  * **walk-throughs**: get an entire team together to provide feedback / discuss
  * **simulation**: entire team speaks about how they would respond
  * **parallel tests**: no longer simulation, plan is activated and hardware activated
  * **full-interruption tests**: shutting down primary and switching over to alternate environment
* combination of types possible

### After action reports

* reports contain what worked well and what did not
* reports should be written after **disaster recovery** or **business continuity** event
* this includes a successful activation
* structure
  * executive summary
  * detailed summary
    * what happened?
    * who was involved?
    * what contributed to success/failure?
  * lessons learned
    * what worked well
    * what did not
  * next steps
